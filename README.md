# The-Data-Repository-Python
In This repository I'll be listing all of my data related projects.
This repository follows a general rule:
  1.All projects codes are in a folder called (codes)
  2.All of the results are in a folder called (results)
    a.Each project's codes has it's own folder in the (codes) folder
    b.Each project's results has it's own folder in the (results) folder
    c.Each project has it's own README.txt file that explains the Details of the project & The skills Used.
